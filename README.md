# PoseTrack
Sitting for long hours, we have stopped bothering about the consequences it holds to adversely affect our body language and posture.
With the help of a webcam and trained data that can guide us to maintain a healthy posture, we are creating a web extension that keeps an eye on us
throughout and pings us when the posture is not maintained!  
This helps to maintain a proper posture. This is required not just to maintain our health and proper body language but will give a good impression via our body language in online meetups and classes.
